## Research Gaps and Future Directions

While significant advancements have been made in emotion recognition using various biosignals and deep learning techniques, several research gaps remain:

1. **Bioimpedance Frequency Scanning**: Limited research exists on using frequency-scanned bioimpedance measurements specifically for emotion recognition, despite its potential for capturing neural activity with high precision.

2. **Emotion Amplification**: Current research focuses heavily on emotion recognition, with limited exploration of technologies to amplify or enhance emotional experiences based on the recognized emotions.

3. **Multimodal Integration**: Although some studies use multiple modalities, there's a need for more sophisticated integration methods that can provide a more complete and accurate picture of emotional states.

4. **Emotion Sharing Systems**: Research on systems that allow real-time sharing of emotional states between users is sparse, particularly those that create a meaningful connection between users based on emotional synchronization.

5. **Blockchain for Emotion Data**: The use of blockchain technology to secure and manage emotional data and generated content has not been extensively explored.

6. **Generative Models for Emotional Content**: While generative models like GANs and VAEs are well-studied, their application to creating personalized emotion-amplifying content is an emerging area.

These research gaps align with the novel aspects of the proposed emotion amplification and sharing system, which aims to address these limitations and advance the state-of-the-art in affective computing.
